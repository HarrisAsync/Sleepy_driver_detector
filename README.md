# Sleepy_driver_detector

Introducing Sleepy Driver Detector - an innovative solution to prevent drowsy driving and increase road safety.

## Description

Our product utilises a camera to detect closed eyelids as an early sign of drowsiness and fatigue in drivers. Eyelids closed continuously for approximately three seconds trigger a quick alert sound and an automated voice that advises the driver to take rest. A series of such detections would subsequently trigger an electrical stimulation in the wristband accessory that the driver will be required to wear (primarily for drivers with hearing loss). This ensures that they are aware of their state and can take action to prevent accidents.

We believe our product has the potential to save lives and make the roads a safer place. Our mission is to prevent drowsy driving and make the roads a safer place for all.
